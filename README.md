# Text2Ascii

CvsClient.mod.cvs has been created by Pieter Muller on 25-Mar-2003 and stored in the SourceForge CVS repository of project [NativeOberon](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/) as ASCII output of itself. Its purpose is to create escape sequences for non ASCII parts for converting Oberon Textfiles which are in no way pure ASCII texts to pure ASCII so that these can be handled by source code revision systems. Oberon Textfiles can contain formating, active elements (like running clocks or animated pictures), active plots, folds and many things more. These are in general binary objects. Almost all sources of the Oberon System and the compiler were stored as Oberon Textfiles until around 2013/2015. I recovered CvsClient.mod.cvs from the CVS repository and transferred it to this place on 29-Dec-2020. There are only a hand full of places (i.e. in lines 1-3, 4, 430, 432, 447, 449, 559, 561, 948, and 950), where such escape sequences have to be removed manually to create a compilable source. I changed the original name CvsClient to Text2ASCII becaus imho CvsClient obscures the relevant usage a bit.

More info about the way the binary content is handled can be found in [CvsClient.Mod.cvs](https://github.com/btreut/Text2Ascii/blob/552be57e2324d2feb634ec2d930480953a6d2e29/CvsClient.Mod.cvs#L1012) after line 1012.
