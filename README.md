# Text2Ascii

CvsClient.mod.cvs has been created by Pieter Muller on 25-Mar-2003 and stored in the SourceForge CVS repository of project [NativeOberon](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/) as ASCII output of itself. Its purpose is to create escape sequences for non ASCII parts for converting Oberon Textfiles which are in no way pure ASCII texts to pure ASCII so that these can be handled by source code revision systems. I recovered it from the CVS repository and transferred it to this place on 29-Dec-2020.

More info about the way the binary content is handled can be found in [CvsClient.Mod.cvs](https://github.com/btreut/Text2Ascii/blob/552be57e2324d2feb634ec2d930480953a6d2e29/CvsClient.Mod.cvs#L1012) after line 1012.
