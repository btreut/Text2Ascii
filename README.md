# Text2Ascii

CvsClient.mod.cvs has been created by Pieter Muller on 25-Mar-2003 and stored in the CVS repository of project NativeOberon on pure ASCII SourceForge. Its purpose is to convert Oberon Textfiles which are in no way pure ASCII texts to that format so that these could be handled by source code revision systems. I recoverd it from the CVS repo and transferred it to this place on 29-Dec-2020.
