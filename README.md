# Text2Ascii

CvsClient.mod.cvs has been created by Pieter Muller on 25-Mar-2003 and stored in the SourceForge CVS repository of project NativeOberon (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/) as ASCII output of itself. Its purpose is to convert Oberon Textfiles which are in no way pure ASCII texts to that format so that these could be handled by source code revision systems. I recovered it from the CVS repository and transferred it to this place on 29-Dec-2020.

More info about it can be found in CvsClient.Mod.cvs starting line 984.
